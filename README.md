Shadoe-qt is an in-development QT-based drop-down terminal emulator similar to 
the consoles used in PC games such as Quake and Half-Life 2. Shadoe-qt is being 
built from the ground up to be as lightweight as possible with no reliance on
KDE libraries, making it great for GTK+ and QT-based desktops alike. 

Information about the current version of Shadoe-qt (including new features and 
changes) can be found in the file [NEWS](./NEWS).

For building and installation instructions, please see the file [INSTALL](./INSTALL)

The two subdirectories, `src` and `doc`, contain the source code files and 
manual for Shadoe-qt, respectively.

Shadoe-qt is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License, 
version 3.  For complete information, see the file [COPYING](./COPYING).

Shadoe-qt is dedicated to my ol' dog Shadow (aka, Doe-Doe) who was laid to rest 
in July of 2011.
