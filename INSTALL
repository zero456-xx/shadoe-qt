Other than the normal build dependcies as described in the README, shadoe-qt also
requires CMake (instead of the usual autotools) in order to properly build and 
create the program for installation and use.

Once the proper build dependecies and CMake are installed, open a terminal and 
change your current working directory to the the same directory from which this 
file resides.

For example, if you downloaded shadoe-qt as an archive (such as shadoe-qt-0.1.tar.bz2) 
and extracted it to your home directory, type into your terminal:

    cd ~/shadoe-qt-0.1

Next type the following commands one after the other to build shadoe-qt (without 
the quotes):

    'cmake .'
    'make'

Finally, we install the program by typing:

    make install

Note you must have root privileges in order to install the program.  For 
example, this can be done on Ubuntu-based distributions or Linux installations
where the current user is part of the administrator group by typing:

    sudo make install

And entering the password for the current user.

Or, for Fedora or other Linux installations with a root account type (_WITH_ the 
quotes):

    su -c 'make install'

And enter the password for root.

That's it!  Enjoy shadoe-qt!
